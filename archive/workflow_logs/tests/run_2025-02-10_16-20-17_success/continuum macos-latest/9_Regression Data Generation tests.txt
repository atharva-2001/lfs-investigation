2025-02-10T16:24:53.2586880Z   jsonschema.RefResolver is deprecated as of v4.18.0, in favor of the https://github.com/python-jsonschema/referencing library, which provides more compliant referencing behavior as well as more flexible APIs for customization. A future release will remove RefResolver. Please file a feature request (on referencing) if you are missing an API for the kind of customization you need.
