2025-01-10T12:48:00.8057088Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8060722Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8063298Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8065782Z 
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8066790Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8069193Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8070586Z 
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8071171Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8072139Z 
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8072742Z Or undo this operation with:
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8073699Z 
2025-01-10T12:48:00.8074810Z   git switch -
